Technologies used: Java EE backend with Wildfly 12 deployment server, MySQL database, Angular frontend, Hue API.
Backend currently unused. I initially thought about saving scenes and rooms there but I'm not so sure anymore that even works. If I use it at all, it will be for saving user data.

TODO NEXT: delete lights from groups, style add-to-group and delete view

TODO maybe: make back and delete button into component
